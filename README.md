## vim-colorpack

A package of vim colorschemes collected from around the web and packaged into a repository suitable for use with [vunlde](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) or [pathogen]()

## Vundle

If you're using vundle, simply add the following to your vim configuarion:

 ```
 Bundle derekprior/vim-colorpack
 ```
 
Launch vim and run the `:BundleInstall` command to install. Color schemes should be available to be set on next run of vim.

## Pathogen

Try vundle. No? Okay then:
1. cd to your bunlde directory (i.e. ~/.vim/bunlde)
2. run `git clone https://github.com/derekprior/vim-colorpack`

Color schemes should be available to be set on next run.

## But, Why?

I keep my vimrc on GitHub but like to manage all of my vim dependencies in Vundle so that my environment is easily replicated across machines and easy to update. I got tired of seeking out (and often coming up empty on) repositories for each invidual color scheme. This is for my own use, primarily, but if it helps you, great. 

Clone for your own list of color schemes or submit a pull request with an addition.
